# Ginn Rummy Bot
 A bot, which plays and calculates, based on statistics, the best strategies to win a gane of Ginn Rummy


The main point of the program is to calculate whether a given card from the deck is a valuable addition to the hand of the player.
If it is above a sertain threshold, the player will swap the card for one, that is not as good. 
The project is built in steps as follows:
1) Configure a working deck - v
2) Create a player hand that is easy to work with - v
3) Sort that hand into the appropriate manner - v
4) Calculate the best combinations that are possible by that hand - v
5) Calculate the chance, that the next card is 'good'
6) Implement swapping mechanics
7) Implement end-game conditions
 * v - Completed
